## 🎯 About
1v1 Sudoku is a site for two players to go head to head to see who is the fastest at completing an identical sudoku board.
The main reason for this app was to, honestly, prove to my wife I was, once and for all, the supreme champion of sudoku in our house.

## ✨ Features
- Both players get served identical boards for fairness
- Real time winner/loser prompts (when a user finishes a board, it instantly sends both users to a "winner/loser page"
- Sudoku board noting toggle
- Board difficulty selection
- Click cell companion number, row, square highlighting
